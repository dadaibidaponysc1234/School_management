# IMPROVEMENTS CATEGORIZED BY IMPACT & COMPLEXITY

## üî¥ CRITICAL - MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL REFACTORING REQUIRED
*These changes require extensive refactoring, affect multiple files, and may break existing functionality*

### 1. **App Structure Reorganization** 
- **Issue**: Monolithic structure - moving models out of user_registration to proper apps
- **Impact**: Affects imports, serializers, views, admin, migrations across entire codebase
- **Effort**: 2-3 weeks of careful refactoring
- **Risk**: High - potential for breaking changes, complex migration dependencies

### 2. **ManyToMany Relationship Implementation**
- **Issue**: Replace manual junction tables with proper ManyToMany fields + through models
- **Impact**: Major ORM query changes, serializer updates, view logic modifications
- **Effort**: 2-3 weeks

### 3. **Remove ClassDepartment Model + Implement M2M**
- **Issue**: Replace redundant model with ManyToMany relationship between Class and Department
- **Impact**: Database schema changes, migration complexity, query refactoring
- **Effort**: 1-2 weeks
- **Risk**: High - data migration, potential data loss if not handled carefully

## üü° MODERATE - SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WITH MANAGEABLE IMPACT
*These require substantial work but are more contained and less risky*

### 4. **Primary Key Naming Standardization**
- **Issue**: Inconsistent PK naming (year_id vs id)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT TIME EXTENSION JUSTIFICATION

**Current Issues Affecting Production Readiness:**
- **Maintainability**: Single massive models file (600+ lines)
- **Scalability**: Redundant queries, no optimization
- **Data Integrity**: Race conditions in save methods
- **Team Development**: Merge conflicts, unclear ownership

**Recommended Extension**: **8-12 weeks** for proper refactoring
- **Critical Phase**: 4-6 weeks (foundational changes)
- **Optimization Phase**: 3-4 weeks (performance & structure)  
- **Polish Phase**: 1-2 weeks (minor improvements)

## üìù ORIGINAL IMPROVEMENT NOTES

### Original List of Improvements:

- Change structure of the app to make each app pluggable e.g. by moving many of the models out of the user_registration app to the actual apps where they are used. Cancels out Monolithic Structure - which makes code unmaintanable

- this is not a really crucial problem right now, but... The primary_keys have an inconsistent naming convention e.g year_id for Year Model and id for SuperAdmin Model. It might end up affecting a lot in the long run. Best thing's to switch to default 'id' for every Model

- Improve the relationship between Role and SuperAdmin (I feel a UserRole Model is harder to manage as django ORM already has a ManytoManyField specifier). Infact this kind of error occurs through out the entire models file. We can Use ManyToMany Relationships with through models to change this

- Many of the profiles e.g School, SuperAdmin, have similar fields. Im thinking of creating an abstract Model (not saved in the db) called Profile and then allow these models inherit its fields in order to reduce no. of code. We can impelement this in other fields as well e.g created_at and updated_at

- change status field in Year and Term model to active (This might affect data being served at the frontend) in order to better align with school management terminologies

- change profile_picture_path to profile_picture in Student Model

- change status field in student model to use Enum Types (TEXTChoices in Django) so that it's value it's limited to a range of values e.g ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, EXPELLED, GRADUATED, NOT_ADMITTED

- remove '/create' from urls where a POST request is sent in order to create a resource

- remove school field from ClassDepartment model. School is already a field on both the class and department model. It's redundant, infact it occurs in other Models as well e.g Term

- Remove Class DepartMent Model implementation as Classes can be related to departments using the many to many field

- the save override logic is very dangerous, if it fails, the model is left in a corrupted state. django database transactions can fix this, it's not a big deal

- the related names while relating objects have an inconsistent convention as well e.g school_teachers and teachers

- In the Student Model, admission number and school should be unique together

### Original Development Time Extension Request:

Sir the code is ready but some subtle issues e.g:
Maintainability (single massive models file)
Scalability (redundant queries, no optimization)
Data Integrity (race conditions in save methods)
can lead to problems.
Can the development time be extended

### UNGROUPED ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Timetable is better not related to ClassTimetable and Teacher timetable, instead, it should be an abstract class and should be inherited
- remove User

#### Serializers in user_registration
in CustomTokenObtainPairSerializer:
- line 63:  change queryset and data to reflect Many to Many field changes
- This serializer does too much; It both authenticates and returns full user details, This breaks the law of standard APIs. Change it to only authenticate and define a me endpoint

in SchoolCreateSerializer:
line 234 - remove custom validation logic and just set fields to unique in Model

in SchoolListSerializer:
- in Models Change SuperAdmin surname field to last_name and reflect changes in get_registered_by method 

in SubscriptionSerializer:
- remove school_name field as it is redundant. school primary key field is already there
- Methods get_live_number_of_students and the likes are already in the Model, there's no need to duplicate them in the serializer

in ComplianceVerificationSerialiazer:
- Remove school_name from  as it redundant, school primary_key field is already there
- I think there's something wrong with the accrediation_certificates and proof_of_registration fields, I don't think the use_url option is needed

in MessageSerializer:
- Specify fields explicitly, don't use "__all__"

in RegistrationPinSerializer:
- remove school_name, leave school

**Note to self:** Ask former backend dev why he kept fetching the school name?

The entire Student, Teacher and SchoolAdmin Serializers, seriously have problems, change that!
These are in the user_registration app

### Suggest Using Djoser for this Project!


User_Management ViewSets
- Move Pagination settion to a pagination.py file
- queries should be optimized with select_related and prefetch related
- remove query for all Roles from












-------------
Sir, I'm reviewing the Endpoint 1st part:
Here's what I think:
1. The Login Endpoint does too much.
Optimal Endpoints should have returned only access and refresh tokens...
We can create an api/users/me where details about the user can be returned.
The amount of data being returned can cause the ednpoint to be slow


2. Sir Can I talk to the former developer that worked on this project?

3. Can a user have multiple roles sir? Why is there a many-to-many relationship through UserRole between a USer and his/her role?

4. Sir, Why does the api/superadmins/create return a full role object? Only the UUID should be returned, the frontend can send a query to api/roles/<:uuid> in order to retrieve these details.

Sir, these are just a few... This API and it's endpoints is not optimal for performance reasons, it doesn't fit industry standards. 
It'll work, but it can't handle a lot of users efficiently. And I'm guessing this is a MultiSchool Project
